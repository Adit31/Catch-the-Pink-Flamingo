# Catch-the-Pink-Flamingo
It is a Big Data capstone project based on a made-up game of Catch the Pink Flamingo where there are different users collectively in a team and progress through different levels of the game.
With each level, the difficulty of the finding the flamingos across the world map grid will become tougher. The users in a team can chat and make in-app purchases to help advance through the game.
First off, we make a decision tree for classification of users in two categories namely HighRollers (who make purchases above $5)  and PennyPinchers (less than $5). We create a KNIME workflow to help us visualizing the result of analysis.
